Hi, I am PeiYun-Cai! I am a passionate software engineer with 4 years of experience. I recently focused on developing microservices with event-driven system for different applications, including Push Notification System (email/sms/push/webhook), user authorization and authentication (OAuth 2.0 and OIDC), data synchronization by utilizing Change Data Capture techniques (MySQL binlog parsed by Maxwell and sent to Kafka), and etc. I love coding and enjoy expanding my knowledge by reading tech books regularly during the weekends and on free times during the weekdays. The knowledge that I gain from books and the internet helps me a lot when working and gives me more motivation to continuously improve myself. While working, I try my best to contribute to the company by doing as much as possible, learning lessons from failures, getting things done quickly, and picking up new things quickly. Currently, I am working for PayPay Corp. (a mobile payment startup in Japan), as a member of the User Module team (critical team), which is responsible for user authentication, authorization, all user related information handling and push notification. Our microservices have 2000 tps and can even rise more during campaign periods. From developing, testing, releasing, to monitoring, each of these tasks gave me lots of great experiences and at the same time gave me the drive to keep on improving myself and use the best of my abilities to contribute to the company as much as possible!
The journey keeps on going! :)
